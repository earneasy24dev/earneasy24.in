            The first and the most popular way to
            <strong>make money online in India</strong> is working as a

          <p>
            On these platforms, you can find clients for any kind of skill that
            you possess. A number of college students do freelancing to meet
            their extra expenditures. Even there are people who are full time
            working as freelancers. The best thing about this is that no one is
            your boss. You offer work to some online clients and they pay you
            for that. You also have chances to work with some of the biggest
            companies around the globe without even joining them.

            You can decide your niche depending on your skills and also
            interests and hobbies. If you are good at writing, you can work as a
            content writer. If you have knowledge about website development, you
            can work as a website developer. You can offer graphic work, video
            and audio editing, content creation, scriptwriting, songwriting and
            many more.

            Earning from freelancing work is directly proportional to your

            <strong>Important Tips&nbsp;</strong>
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              You have to have a good portfolio in order to get good clients.
              Your clients interact with your portfolio before they interact
              with you. Your portfolio should be simple, to the point and
              attractive. Mention your past work experience and other details
              for your clients to have a better idea about your work.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Customer reviews also play an important role. So try to satisfy
              your clients so that you get good reviews which in turn, help you
              attract more clients.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Try building a network with other people who are in the same field
              as you. They can also help you get clients and can give
              recommendations to others about you. You can also seek help from
              them and learn more about your field.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              You might not get clients immediately when you start your
              freelancing career. Have patience and improve your skills. You
              will slowly start getting clients and then gradually, you can also
              increase your charges as you master your skills.

            Starting your own website is another way to
            <strong>make money online in India</strong>. If you have an interest
            in anything like gadgets or books or health and fitness or any other
            specific category, you can become a blogger. You have to start your
            own website, upload your content regularly and you are ready to go!

            If you work for a decent time with decent knowledge about the
            market, your audience and SEO and other basic things, you can make a
            good amount of money. Once you start getting traffic on your
            website, then it opens multiple ways to earn money online. You can
            earn through ads promotions or can do affiliate marketing (we will
            later discuss affiliate marketing in detail in this article) through
            your website.
          </p>
          <br />

            Vlogging is becoming more popular among the viewers than blogging.
            If you think you have got good speaking and presentation skills,
            have the creativity and ability to create engaging content, you can

          <p>
            YouTube is one of the most popular platforms for vlogging which can
            help you <strong>make money online in India</strong>. Starting is a
            tough thing but, things get better with time and you will eventually
            find that your content creation qualities and abilities enhance with
            time and experience.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You have to decide your category depending upon your interest and
            skills. If you are good at drawing, you can start an art channel,
            you can become an online tutor, if you have knowledge and interest
            in gadgets and smartphones, you can start a tech channel. You can
            start a music, gaming, news or cooking channel.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you are good at some task, you can start putting tutorial videos.
            Every type of content has its own market. But, if you ask the most
            viewed category then, it is comedy and entertainment on YouTube.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But one thing that you should keep in your mind is that you have to
            be unique and creative. Creating an audience base takes a lot of
            time and effort. So be ready for the hard work.
